# CS431_Multithreading_Reference
A simple chat application: Server side implementation using multithreading
Allows multiple clients to connect to server. (Note the implementation of multiple threads, to accept communication from multiple clients.)
Server echoes the messages from clients connected to it
To run start the server run the following commands:

1. Compile the server program:
  javac serverJava.java 
2. Start server:
  java serverJava
  
Server is now open and accepting connections.
  
To run client, open another terminal & run the following command:
python client1.py 

From here on, any message you type from client terminal, gets printed on the server's terminal, until you type "exit".
